      <p>
        During the Summer 2025 semester, I completed a four month co-op work term at <strong>EQ Bank (Equitable Bank)</strong> in Toronto. 
        My role was with the <strong>Retail Lending Technology team</strong>, where I contributed to projects involving API integration, 
        system improvements, and documentation. This opportunity allowed me to apply classroom concepts in a professional fintech 
        setting while gaining valuable exposure to enterprise-scale workflows.

      <h2 class="section-title"><i class="fa-solid fa-bullseye icon-title"></i>Goals & Learning Outcomes</h2>
  
      <div class="container-box">
        <p>
          At the start of my co-op, I set out several goals aligned with both my academic growth and job responsibilities. 
          These included strengthening my technical foundation, gaining exposure to enterprise technologies, and improving 
          professional communication. My goals were directly related to my job tasks, which required programming, API integration, 
          and collaboration with teammates in an agile environment. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to build skills in debugging, writing cleaner code, and using version control effectively, all of which will 
          benefit my next work experience by making me a more efficient contributor to large codebases. I also aimed to explore 
          technologies such as <strong>Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Angular, and CI/CD pipelines</strong>, since they are widely used 
          in enterprise environments and will be valuable in future co-op terms and career opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on these goals, I am proud to say I completed the majority of them. I successfully strengthened my technical 
          expertise, became more comfortable with industry tools, and improved my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly. 
          While I met my learning goals, one area I would have liked more hands on experience in was <strong>frontend frameworks 
          like Angular</strong>. Although I gained exposure through shadowing and documentation, I did not contribute as deeply to 
          that area as I did with backend technologies.
